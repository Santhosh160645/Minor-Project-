# Propounding First Artificial Intelligence Approach

This is a web-based AI minor project developed using **Python** and **Django**, designed to implement and demonstrate machine learning-based intelligence within a web application.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system allows users to interact with a platform that performs AI-based processing using uploaded datasets. Admin (Service Provider) can view results, manage data, and oversee model performance.

### 🔧 Key Modules:
- **Remote_User**: Frontend for the user to upload and interact with the system.
- **Service_Provider**: Admin panel for training models, analyzing data, and monitoring results.
- **Template**: HTML templates for UI rendering, along with an `images/` folder for visual assets.
